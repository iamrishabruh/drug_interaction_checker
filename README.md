## Overview

The **KP Drug Interaction Feature** is a proof of concept (POC) developed to integrate the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Library of Medicine (NLM) Drug Interaction API into Kaiser Permanente's (KP) flagship iOS application. This feature is designed to enhance patient safety by providing comprehensive insights into potential multi-drug interactions, empowering KP members with vital health information directly within the KP mobile app.

> **Note:** The NIH NLM Drug Interaction API used in this project is currently deprecated. Future integrations should consider alternative APIs or updated endpoints.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Drug Interaction Insights:** Provides detailed information on potential interactions between multiple medications, aiding in the mitigation of polypharmacy risks.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Seamlessly integrates into the existing KP iOS application, ensuring a consistent and intuitive user experience.
  
- **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Leverages the NIH NLM Drug Interaction API to fetch and display up-to-date information on drug interactions.
  
- **Adherence to KP Standards:** Developed following Kaiser Permanente's design and coding standards to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Motivation

In the realm of healthcare, understanding drug interactions is paramount for ensuring patient safety, especially for individuals managing multiple medications. By embedding this feature into the KP flagship application, we strive to:

- **Enhance Patient Safety:** Minimize the risk of adverse drug interactions through timely and accurate information dissemination.
  
- **Empower Users:** Equip KP members with the necessary tools to make informed decisions regarding their medication regimens.
  
- **Support Healthcare Providers:** Provide healthcare professionals with reliable interaction data to assist in patient consultations and treatment planning.

## Architecture

The KP Drug Interaction Feature is built using SwiftUI for the user interface and leverages Xcode for development. The feature communicates with the NIH NLM Drug Interaction API to fetch interaction data, processes the information, and presents it within the KP iOS application.

### Components

- **UI Layer:** SwiftUI views adhering to KP's design guidelines.
- **Networking Layer:** Handles API requests and responses using `URLSession` and `Combine`.
- **Data Layer:** Models and manages drug interaction data.
- **Error Handling:** Robust mechanisms to manage API failures and data inconsistencies.
- **Persistence Layer:** (If applicable) Caches interaction data for offline access using Core Data or similar solutions.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.7
- **Frameworks:** SwiftUI, Combine
- **Development Environment:** Xcode 14+
- **API:** NIH NLM Drug Interaction API (Deprecated)
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (or specify if different)
- **Testing:** XCTest for unit and UI testing

## Installation
